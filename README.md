# TechSpin-Pong-Game
Python Game Created using the Tkinter Library

I have crafted a captivating single-player GUI game entirely from scratch utilizing Pythonâ€™s Tkinter Library. This game puts a twist on the traditional two-player ping pong game. In this version, a single player must prevent the ball from passing through. As the player's score improves, both the speed and frequency of the ball increase. The player starts with 5 lives and has 3 minutes to accumulate as many points as possible. Each time the ball slips past the paddle, a life is lost. The game concludes once all lives are depleted.

For the enhancement of the game, I have implemented the game with animations, cheat codes, and a boss key, ensuring seamless gameplay through quality assurance. 

Special Cheats Included
1. Press i to Increase paddle Size.
2. Press d to Decrease the Ball Speed
3. Press s to add a live.
4. Press q and then c to see what it does!
